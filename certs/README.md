# Debugging in Azure DevOps

In order to debug via Azure DevOps, you need to run the dev server using https. A self signed cert should be generated and trusted on your local system.

A self signed .crt and .key can be generated using the provided generate-cert.sh script. 

After generating the cert, you must add the .crt to your trusted certificate store.
